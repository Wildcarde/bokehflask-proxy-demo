# bokeh + flask + apache using docker containers

This is a toy example used to structure out bokeh, flask, and apache for use together in a school project. It resolves the problems around embedding bokeh in other applications and manages the reverse proxy settings to make everything work as desired. It is quiet old and while I personally have no use for it it may be helpful for somebody stumbling across this need in the future so I'm archiving it instead of deleting it.
